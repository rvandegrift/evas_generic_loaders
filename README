Additional "generic" loaders for Evas that are stand-alone executables
evas may run from its generic loader module.

Generic loaders currently provided:

  XCF (.xcf .xcf.gz)

  PDF (using poppler)
    use -key option to specific what page to get and load options for size
    Should we add mupdf ?

  PS (using libspectre)
    use -key option to specific what page to get and load options for size
    Should we use directly libgs ?

  RAW (using libraw)

  MPG/AVI/OGV/MOV/MKV/WMV etc. (using Gstreamer)
    Should we add libxine and vlc ?

Possible fun ones:

  DVI (using DVIlib, see edvi)

  DJVU (using libdjvu)

  PPT/PPTX
    (beats me how u can render a page from these without a whole
     office impl - but worth a try? libopenoffice/libllibreoffice if
     it ever happens?)
