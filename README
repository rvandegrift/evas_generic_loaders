Additional "generic" loaders for Evas that are stand-alone executables
evas may run from its generic loader module.

Generic loaders currently provided:

  XCF (.xcf .xcf.gz)

Wanted:

  RAW
    (libopenraw1 ??)
  PDF
    (use -key option to specific what page to get and load options for size
     and use poppler and/or mupdf - look at epdf)
  PS
    (use -key option to specific what page to get and load options for size
     and use ghostscript (libgs) to render etc.)

Possible fun ones:

  MPG/AVI/OGV/MOV/MKV/WMV etc.
    (use gstreamer and/or libxine or libvlc and snap one frame from the
     middle somewhere)
  PPT/PPTX
    (beats me how u can render a page from these without a whole
     office impl - but worth a try? libopenoffice/libllibreoffice if
     it ever happens?)
